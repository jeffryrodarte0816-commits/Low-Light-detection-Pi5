# Installing ultralytics for yolo on jetson orin nano
Verify version of python, what version of CUDA the OS supports, and how to install pytorch first
```bash
python --version
```
```bash
nvidia-smi
```
Now go to website for quickstart for ultralytics and place paramters needed for installation, install "pip"since we do have CUDA for the jetson.  
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
